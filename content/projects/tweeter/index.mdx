Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone, using Express, jQuery, and Ajax.

On this app users can submit tweets provided they are within the character limit, they are then dynamically rendered and displayed above the older tweets.

The page features responsive design elements and is desigend to look good on both mobile and desktop.

Some additional features include a toggle for displaying and hiding the tweet submission form, a 'scroll-to-top' button that only appears once the tweet submission form has been scrolled past, and SASS driven CSS.
