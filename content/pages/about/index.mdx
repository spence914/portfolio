# About Me

Hi I'm Spencer,

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer based in Vancouver, BC, with a unique background and a wealth of experience to draw on.

I graduated from The University of British Columbia in 2015 with a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in English Literature and minoring in Economics.

For most of my twenties, I worked my way up the retail food chain, going from greeting customers to sales, and eventually to management. I've worked in a wide variety of sales environments, from boutique footwear and apparel to wholesale backpacks.

In the summer of 2023, I decided to make the jump to Web Development and enrolled at Lighthouse Labs. This past May, I completed their Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, and I'm incredibly excited to enter the industry! I am open to both permanent and contract roles.

Please feel free to reach out through the contact page!
